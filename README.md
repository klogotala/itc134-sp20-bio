In my family I am one of eight kids. Originally from Sacramento, California but moved to Washington for about 17 years now. I still go back and visit almost every summer or whenever I can. I’m the sixth to older and I’m also the second to further my education. 
I like learning. Things are changing all the time and with technology coming up in the business world I’ve taken an interest in software development. I’m not a tech genius but I do have experience. I attended Eastern Washington University for computer tech engineering.
